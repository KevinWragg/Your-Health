THRIVE PROJECT

Thank you for taking the time to view my submission


Please be aware that I have not fully tested the site for compatability with all browsers (developed
using chrome), and there may be some bugs/tweeks that I would have made given the time to do more
extensive testing.

I am not fully satisified with the current design, I usually take the longest time considering a design
than I do in the implementation, so given the time constraints this was I came up with.

I opted to create a custom slider on the homepage, while I could have used a prebuilt slider template
I took this as an opportunity to create a custom script, there are some little issues I would have
addressed given enough time, namely the "next arrow" sliding with the content, and the content causing
horizontal scroll bars, I attempted to hide the overflow but I believe I had issues due to the fact
that I needed to select the stored html, rather than the current element on the page.

The maps aspect ratio changes, this causes images distortion on the static image, as I understand it
using the google map api would have addressed this issue, so the aspect ratio would not have been
an issue on a live map.

I considered that making a top to bottom navbar may have been a better choice, I usually opt for horizontal
navbars and I don't think this design was ideal for having centralized content, which lead to having to push
the contents to the right as the viewport gets smaller.


All in all I am looking for a junior role and im eager to work in a team with other developers with the hope to
grow my knowledge and experience, thanks again for your consideration.
