THRIVE PROJECT

Thank you for taking the time to view my submission


Given the time available I am not satisified with the current design, I consider design my weakest
trait given my lack of experience, however I am confident in putting together an existing design from
a template and I hope this project gives you some insight into my current development proficency.

I opted to create a custom slider on the homepage, while I could have used a prebuilt slider template
I took this as an opportunity to create a custom script, there are some little issues I would have
addressed given enough time, namely the "next arrow" sliding with the content, and the content causing
horizontal scroll bars, I attempted to hide the overflow but I believe I had issues due to the fact
that I needed to select the stored html, rather than the current element on the page.

The maps aspect ratio changes, this causes images distortion on the static image, as I understand it
using the google map api would have addressed this issue, so the aspect ratio would not have been
an issue on a live map.

This is actually the first time using a vertical navbar, I usually opt for horizontal navbars and I
don't think this design was ideal for having centralized content, which lead to having to push the
contents to the right as the viewport got smaller.


All in all I am looking for a junior role in the hope to grow my knowledge alongside more experienced
developers, thanks again for your consideration.
